# A PHP web application with Zend.

I'm building a storefront application using PHP and Zend per the book, _Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development_, by Keith Pope.

### Added logging to the application:
* write to a log file for production (requires correct permissions on the log file)
* otherwise write to browser Firebug plugin

### Category hierarchy implemented.

### No open issues currently.
