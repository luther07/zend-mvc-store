# A PHP web application with Zend.

I'm building a storefront application using PHP and Zend per the book, _Zend Framework 1.8 Web Application Development_, by Keith Pope. 
Link to purchase book from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Zend-Framework-1-8-Application-Development/dp/1847194222/)

### Added logging to the application:
* write to a log file for production (requires correct permissions on the log file)
* otherwise write to browser Firebug plugin

### Category hierarchy implemented.

### No open issues currently.
